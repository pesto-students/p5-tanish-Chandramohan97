            <h3> Veganism and Climate Change</h3>
            <p > According to the latest IPCC report, agriculture and other land use is the third leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions, behind energy and industry.One recent study suggested that if everyone in the world were to go vegan, and animal agriculture practices were to cease, greenhouse gases would be stabilized for 30 years and 68 percent of carbon dioxide emissions would be offset for the rest of the century.</p>
